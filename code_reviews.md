OSS software thrives on contribution, but a lot of projects on Github and beyond never see so much as a comment.  One of the goals of this group is to change that by auditing projects big and small.  A standard will be created, or an existing one used, for each language, then applied to each yegcollective project and to each audited project.

Standards will include such things as tabs vs. spaces, how many tabs/spaces, general syntax preferences or whether tests are required.  The results of the audit aren't relevant and don't need to be shared with the project owner (but you could), the point is to encourage the auditor to identify the faults and propose solutions to fix them.  Create issues/PRs, update stagnant issues/PRs, write documentation or tests, do what you think will help the project move in the right direction.
