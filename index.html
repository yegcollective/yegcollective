  <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
  <p>The YegCollective group has a simple goal, to create meaningful software solutions to real world problems.  A lot of this software is going to be free, or will take funds only to pay for required services.  We build these products because it's what we like to do, not because it's going to make us obscenely rich.</p>
